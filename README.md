# LiteBrite
An incredibly simple library to treat a terminal screen rather like a litebrite. The goal of this library  is to teach some of the basics of generalization/abstractoin by way of creating simple graphics displays.
At the moment the Makefile is using the assumptions that the library install directory is /usr/lib and the header install directory  is /usr/include if this is not where you want to install this library and header on your system simply change the Makefile.
