# LiteBrite
An incredibly simple library to treat a terminal screen rather like a litebrite. The goal of this library  is to teach some of the basics of generalization/abstractoin by way of creating simple graphics displays.
At the moment the Makefile is using the assumptions that the library install directory is /usr/lib and the header install directory  is /usr/include if this is not where you want to install this library and header on your system simply change the Makefile (for example for Centos on modern systems you probably want /usr/lib64

This library is built on top of ncurses which defines 8 colors (for terminals that have color), for the linux terminal you can use 16 by using <color> and <color> + BOLD for ncurses ACS_BLOCK character. Unfortunately for xterm and gnome-terminal ncurses defaults to '#' instead of the proper extended ASCII block character. For those terminals we can get around the problem by using a space and | A_REVERSE to reverse the color of background text. (experimented with unicode, but the unicode block character doesn't fill the character space). Despite these efforts some terminal programs still may not support the full range of colors (looking at you Moba Xterm).
